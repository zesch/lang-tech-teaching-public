We define a token as a sequence of characters, including punctuation, excluding whitespace. Different capitalization of the same word, e.g. “car” and “Car” are regarded as different types. Different appearances of the same token, e.g. “car” are collapsed to one type “car”. A token is a particular appearance of a given word in a text, i.e. the LIST (or sequence) of tokens represents the text, while the SET of tokens represents the vocabulary and an element in this set is called a type. Consider e.g. the string “1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5”. There are 10 tokens, but there are only 5 types.\n",

If you take a union of a set with itself, you end up with the set itself. Under this consideration, you could answer true.\n",
