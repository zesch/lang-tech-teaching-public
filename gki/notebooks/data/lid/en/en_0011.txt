On January 18, 2012, the English Wikipedia participated in a series of coordinated protests against two proposed laws in the United States Congress—the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA)—by blacking out its pages for 24 hours.[59] More than 162 million people viewed the blackout explanation page that temporarily replaced Wikipedia content.[60][61]
