There are currently 301 language editions of Wikipedia (also called language versions, or simply Wikipedias). As of June 2019, the six largest, in order of article count, are the English, Cebuano, Swedish, German, French, and Dutch Wikipedias.[128] The second and third largest Wikipedias owe their position to the article-creating bot Lsjbot, which as of 2013 had created about half the articles in the Swedish Wikipedia, and most of the articles in the Cebuano and Waray Wikipedias. The latter are both languages of the Philippines.
