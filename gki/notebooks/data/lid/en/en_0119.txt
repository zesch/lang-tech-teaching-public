Wikipedia won two major awards in May 2004.[321] The first was a Golden Nica for Digital Communities of the annual Prix Ars Electronica contest; this came with a €10,000 (£6,588; $12,700) grant and an invitation to present at the PAE Cyberarts Festival in Austria later that year. The second was a Judges' Webby Award for the "community" category.[322] Wikipedia was also nominated for a "Best Practices" Webby award.
