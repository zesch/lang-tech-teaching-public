In 2017–18, after a barrage of false news reports, both Facebook and YouTube announced they would rely on Wikipedia to help their users evaluate reports and reject false news. Noam Cohen, writing in The Washington Post states, "YouTube’s reliance on Wikipedia to set the record straight builds on the thinking of another fact-challenged platform, the Facebook social network, which announced last year that Wikipedia would help its users root out 'fake news'."[23] In answer to the question of 'how engaged are visitors to the site?' Alexa records the daily pageviews per visitor as 3.10 and the daily time on site as 4.11 minutes.[291]
