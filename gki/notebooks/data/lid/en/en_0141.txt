Several free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as Wikipedia (e.g. Everything2),[361] with many later being merged into the project (e.g. GNE).[362] One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was h2g2, which was created by Douglas Adams in 1999. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively light-hearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.
