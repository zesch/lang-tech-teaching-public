Unlike traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia follows the procrastination principle[notes 4][67] regarding the security of its content.[67] It started almost entirely open—anyone could create articles, and any Wikipedia article could be edited by any reader, even those who did not have a Wikipedia account. Modifications to all articles would be published immediately. As a result, any article could contain inaccuracies such as errors, ideological biases, and nonsensical or irrelevant text.
