Critics argue that Wikipedia's open nature and a lack of proper sources for most of the information makes it unreliable.[163] Some commentators suggest that Wikipedia may be reliable, but that the reliability of any given article is not clear.[164] Editors of traditional reference works such as the Encyclopædia Britannica have questioned the project's utility and status as an encyclopedia.[165] Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has claimed that Wikipedia has largely avoided the problem of "fake news" because the Wikipedia community regularly debates the quality of sources in articles.[166]
